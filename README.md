> **Current build status:** Nuera Quicksilver keeps the tested decision-governance foundation it inherited from the challenge build as its regression baseline. NQC evaluation and governance, tool contracts, a draft workflow builder, and an in-process graph runner are implemented foundations. Quicksilver Engine also provides a bounded, provider-neutral final-answer stress harness for multi-step arithmetic and logic traps; it does not request or retain private chain-of-thought. The editor visualizes graph connections and exposes agent retry and handler timeout settings. The runner supports opt-in bounded concurrency for independent low/moderate-impact agent steps; the read-only query route caps this at three. The read-only query worker uses a shared governed-agent contract and returns its full NQC evaluation response. Workflow drafts autosave locally, support validated JSON import/export, and can run an opt-in read-only query-agent path through NQC evaluation. Workflow tools remain blocked. A durable run queue and worker (`@quicksilver/kernel/runtime`) now provide idempotent admission, backpressure, leases, cancellation, retries, and a dead-letter queue, with in-memory, journaled-file, or PostgreSQL storage; cron schedules and signed webhooks can start runs. A single-tenant host process (`@quicksilver/host`) now runs the worker pool, schedules and signed webhooks from configuration, with a bearer-token management API, an encrypted secrets vault, structured logs and Prometheus metrics. Kernel RBAC (tenant isolation, deny-by-default roles, no authority for agents) guards queue operations, the host API and, when configured, per-person supervisor credentials. Decision approvals enforce separation of duties, with an audited sole-operator override, and every query and workflow evaluation is stored as an `evaluationRecord`. Internal TypeScript and dependency-free Python/Go SDK foundations cover workflow validation, safe preview, and opt-in read-only runs; none is published as a stable public API. A first declarative Nuera Quicksilver Agent catalog now supports versioned draft/review/publish governance with dedicated catalog RBAC and rollback-to-draft; it does not install executable plugins or change runtime dispatch. Persistent principal/role administration, multi-tenant hosting, distributed traces, model/cost dashboards, runtime agent registration, and a marketplace remain unimplemented.

The repository is a **tested platform foundation**, not a hosted production
service. Its single-tenant Render host is live for health, readiness, and
persistence-wiring validation, but no effectful provider workflow has been
operated and it is not a multi-tenant production service. The credential-free
verification path covers the kernel, agents, host, Aura, web/security helpers,
and TypeScript packages; the latest CI signal is called out below. The web app
and Studio additionally need their dedicated Sanity project configuration, while
live-agent paths also need model credentials.

| Area | Status | Evidence or next dependency |
|---|---|---|
| NQC Kernel, policy, capability, process and workflow governance | Built and tested | `npm run kernel:test` |
| Durable run queue, worker, triggers and stores | Built and tested | Kernel runtime and store-contract suites |
| Single-tenant host, vault, management API, logs and metrics | Built; Render deployment wiring validated | `npm run host:test` and [Render evidence](./docs/platform/render-operational-evidence-2026-10-05.md) |
| Governed agent profiles and host memory API | Implemented and regression-tested; still partial for production resources and full memory recall | [Agent profiles](./docs/platform/agent-profiles.md), parity items P-017/P-018 |
| Aura intent and provenance layer | Built foundation and tested | `npm run aura:test` |
| Web console and API routes | Builds and security-tested | `npm run build` and `npm run seed:test` |
| Sanity Studio, schema deployment and seed data | Requires dedicated project configuration | `SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID` and Sanity auth |
| Live Context MCP and model-backed planning | Requires external credentials | `npm run verify:mcp` and `npm run verify:llm` |
| Public hosting, browser OIDC and multi-tenant hosting | Render has narrow health/persistence evidence; browser OIDC sign-in and sessions are covered (P-108); multi-tenant hosting remains incomplete | [Current status](./docs/CURRENT-STATUS.md), parity items P-014, P-107 and P-108 |
| Effectful external actions (email, signed webhook) | Built behind human approval; dry run by default; never run against a live provider | [Approved actions](./docs/platform/approved-actions.md), parity item P-095 |

### What has not been proven

Stated plainly, because it is the part a cold reader most needs:

- **CI status is a point-in-time signal.** PR #92 was merged on 2026-10-06
  after the project owner reported its test checks passed. Check the current
  GitHub Actions status for later changes; a passing merge check does not prove
  live business-provider execution or 1.0.0 operational readiness.
- **No real email or webhook has been sent by this code.** The approved-action
  adapters (Resend email, signed webhook) have only been exercised against
  fakes, so there is no operational evidence yet. They ship as dry runs.
- **The decision loop's "Execute" is a simulation.** It records a state change
  and an observed metric; it does not act on the outside world. Real effects go
  through [approved actions](./docs/platform/approved-actions.md) instead.
- **WAES scoring has not been calibrated against a live model provider.**
- **Connectors (Stripe, HubSpot, QuickBooks) have not been run against real accounts.**

The full list, with what each item needs, is in the
[parity matrix](./docs/platform/parity-tests.md).

For a credential-free health check, run `npm run verify`. For contributor setup
and package boundaries, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Project terms
are defined in the [glossary](./docs/GLOSSARY.md).

</p>

---

Give Nuera Quicksilver an objective like *"Reduce production downtime by 20% without increasing OPEX."* A **Nuera Quicksilver Agent** reads a structured company model stored in Sanity and proposes a plan. The **NQC Kernel** applies the deterministic Quicksilver Engine evaluation and then decides what may happen. Each proposed action is auto-approved, sent to a human, or hard-blocked. Every step is recorded as an auditable decision in Sanity.

> **Nuera Quicksilver Agents propose. The NQC Kernel authorizes. The company's playbook is content, and the kernel runs it.**

## What Nuera Quicksilver is building

The [product definition](./docs/NUERA-QUICKSILVER-PRODUCT.md) is the canonical
statement of where this repository is headed. It describes the target, not
current capability.

Nuera Quicksilver is being built as an **intent-driven company operating
system**. A human states an objective and whatever constraints they know, from
"make money" to an exact process. Quicksilver works out what's still undecided,
builds the organization of agents it needs, and runs the company through
governed loops. Every action is proposed by an agent, authorized by the NQC
Kernel, and recorded.

### Layers

| Layer | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Foundation:** platform runtime | Durable runs, triggers, agent manifests, governed memory, routing, SDKs | Foundation |
| **Layer 1:** NQC Kernel loop | Propose → evaluate → authorize → route → supervisor approval → execute and log, for every action | Built / Foundation |
| **Layer 2:** intent loop | Turns an objective into a decision graph whose values are tagged by provenance (`HUMAN_SPECIFIED`, `OBSERVED`, `AGENT_INFERRED`, `SYSTEM_CONSTRAINT`) | Built foundation |
| **Layer 3:** playbook loops | Swappable business playbooks, stored as content: process stages that run workflow graphs | Building blocks / pilot foundation |

### Operating modes

- **Genesis:** starts a business from nothing, using experiments with paid signals and thresholds set in advance.
- **Onboard:** takes over an existing business: connect → interview → backtest → shadow mode → earn autonomy one department at a time.
- **Operate:** runs a validated business, optimizing and reinvesting within governance.

### Goals

1. **Governed autonomy:** every action passes through the NQC Kernel, and agents never hold authority.
2. **Any objective at any autonomy depth,** through a single intent entry point.
3. **Genesis, Onboard and Operate** on one core.
4. **Playbooks as content,** swappable without changing the core.
5. **Capital follows evidence,** through measured experiments.
6. **Accountability:** every decision traced to a human, observed data, an inference or a constraint.
7. **Wellbeing alignment,** with WAES review of every offer, claim and outbound message.
8. **Platform baseline parity,** proven by a pass/fail test for each baseline item.

**Verified milestone baseline:** 0.8.0 (M1–M7 implementation-complete; M7's four acceptance areas pass 89/89 focused tests). The host runs on the founder's computer, and always-on hosting moves to M5. Later enterprise work remains on the M8–M9 path and does not represent a hosted 1.0 release. Following the Nuera RDL versioning standard, Nuera Quicksilver stays on 0.x until all three modes pass the
parity gate; M8 is the enterprise feature-complete 0.9.0 release candidate, and
M9 is the target for completing all new enterprise features and releasing 1.0.0
with operational evidence for every mode.

Milestones M1–M9, the versioning table and the success metrics are in the
[product definition](./docs/NUERA-QUICKSILVER-PRODUCT.md#8-goals). What
exists today is described below.

```

## Why it isn't "just RAG"

A keyword search finds *"Engineering approval is required for parameter changes."* Quicksilver works out things a search can't, and it's clear about which part does what: the **kernel** is deterministic code, the **agent** is the LLM reading Sanity.

| Question | Worked out by |
|---|---|
| Does this actor actually **hold the capability**, and is it granted? | Kernel, from `entity` → `capability` references |
| Which policies **apply**, which are **superseded**, which **conflict**? | Kernel: policy scope + `supersedes[]`; two live policies in the same scope are flagged as a conflict |
| Does any evidence **contradict** the plan, and how confidently? | Agent, from `evidence.contradicts[]` + confidence (GROQ) and the Knowledge Base's own contradiction detection |
| How **risky** is it: base risk, impact, reversibility, uncertainty? | Kernel, a deterministic formula, 0–5 |
| Who has to approve, and **what can happen next**? | Kernel, running the Decision Lifecycle process stored in Sanity |

The seed data includes a real dilemma. Operations Policy 17 and Emergency Policy 4 conflict in the same scope, and a historical incident (confidence 0.92) says the root cause is mechanical, not parameter drift. The agent has to reason through a conflict that is actually in the data, not a staged one.

## The playbook is content

Every decision moves through the **Decision Lifecycle**, a process definition stored as a Sanity document and run by the kernel. It has 8 states and 12 transitions. Its guards are structured data (`{ fact, op, value }`), never code strings.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> proposed
    proposed --> rejected: kernel-reject (hard block)
    proposed --> approved: auto-approve (risk ≤ 2)
    proposed --> awaiting_approval: route-to-human
    awaiting_approval --> awaiting_approval: request-evidence 👤
    awaiting_approval --> approved: approve 👤
    awaiting_approval --> rejected: reject 👤
    approved --> executed: execute-succeeded
    approved --> failed: execute-failed
    executed --> rollback_proposed: propose-rollback 👤
    failed --> rollback_proposed: propose-rollback-after-failure 👤
    rollback_proposed --> rollback_proposed: retry-rollback 👤
    rollback_proposed --> rolled_back: complete-rollback
    rejected --> [*]
    rolled_back --> [*]
```

- **Tighten the autonomy ceiling in Studio** by changing one number, and the next decision follows it, with no redeploy.
- **Illegal jumps are refused** with a plain-English reason. Approve, reject and rollback always need a human click; the kernel and executor can never take them. (Per-person supervisor credentials and kernel RBAC are enforced when `QUICKSILVER_PRINCIPALS` is configured; otherwise a local instance falls back to a single supervisor token. SSO and browser sessions are on the roadmap.)
- **Every step is stamped** with the definition's version and `_rev`, so you can see exactly which rules were in force.
- **A broken definition stops the line.** If a state is unreachable or a guard is malformed, the kernel moves nothing rather than bypassing its own playbook.
- **Optimistic locking**: two simultaneous approvals give exactly one success and one clean `409`.

## Trying it

The live app is https://project-quicksilver.vercel.app. It signs the team in through single sign-on, so judges use an access token instead; the [judge guide](./docs/FOR-JUDGES.md) explains how. To run it yourself, see [Run it locally](#run-it-locally); then:

1. Open the console at `http://localhost:3000`. The objective is pre-filled.
2. Click **Send to Quicksilver**. A real plan takes about a minute.
3. Scroll to **Decisions**. Each card shows the kernel's risk and verdict and a **Process** line (where it is, what can happen next). Click **Show reasoning & evidence** for the policies, evidence and the dashed **Independent review** from the reviewer model.
4. **Approve** a card, **Execute** it (a simulation: nothing outside the console changes; real effects use [approved actions](./docs/platform/approved-actions.md)) and **Observe** the metric. If it moves the wrong way, **propose a rollback**.
5. Open `/decisions` to see every transition, who took it (kernel, human or executor) and when. Open `/workflows` for the draft workflow builder.

Local runs need a configured Sanity project and model credentials. The earlier challenge build, with its own
demo, lives in a separate repository:
[nuerainc/quicksilver-sanity-challenge](https://github.com/nuerainc/quicksilver-sanity-challenge).

## Tests

Run the complete credential-free regression and type-check path with:

```bash
npm run verify
```

The command prints the live test total instead of relying on a manually
maintained number. GitHub Actions runs this credential-free regression and
type-check path for pull requests and pushes to `main`. Live Sanity and
model-provider checks remain separate because they require external credentials.

> **Current CI note (2026-10-06):** PR #88 merged with failed Ubuntu and
> Windows matrix jobs in this path. The next priority is to reproduce and fix
> the shared `host:test` failure, then restore a green cross-platform baseline.

| Check | Command | Credentials |
|---|---|---|
| Kernel, agent, host, Aura, seed/web suites and type checks | `npm run verify` | No |
| Full workspace build | `npm run build` | Dedicated Sanity project for Studio |
| Sanity Context MCP verification | `npm run verify:mcp` | Context MCP credentials |
| Model provider verification | `npm run verify:llm` | Model credentials |

Inherited from the challenge build, and run against that build's live
environment rather than this repository: a live governance stress test (lanes,
races, prompt injection, a broken definition, **17 / 17**) and an automated
live e2e (`npm run e2e:live`, **44 / 44**), both against Decision Lifecycle v2.
They have not been re-run against the dedicated Nuera Quicksilver project.

The challenge-era stress test found real bugs: a risk formula that scored nearly everything 5/5, a failed rollback that could strand a decision, and a strict-schema error on the query route. Each one is fixed and written up in the [build log](./BUILD-LOG.md).

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| App | Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind; the public app is deployed to Vercel with controlled access |
| Content & state | Dedicated Nuera Quicksilver Sanity project (`f87t11g1`), isolated from the public challenge dataset; Studio schema deployment remains pending |
| Agent read path | Sanity **Context MCP**, in both GROQ mode (live dataset) and Knowledge Base mode (cited, with contradiction detection) |
| Agent harness | AI SDK 6 + `@ai-sdk/mcp`, role-based models (planner + independent reviewer; Azure OpenAI in production) |
| Authority | **NQC Kernel**: deterministic TypeScript with no LLM, fail-closed |
| Evaluation | **Quicksilver Engine**: deterministic grounding, tool-failure, and brittleness signals |
| Worker agents | **Nuera Quicksilver Agents**: planner, advisory reviewer, and query agent; kernel manifests gate registered tasks, with the NQC Kernel retaining action authority |
| Write path | `@sanity/client` mutations with `ifRevisionId` optimistic locking |
| Workflow authoring | Draft graph builder, browser-local autosave, validated JSON import/export, immutable shared versions with independent review/publish/rollback, reviewer rationale, safety-aware version diffs, and Sanity audit; published live runs resolve and pin the active version, verify its digest, and expose metadata-only execution history. Editable draft runs remain separate; live runs are opt-in/read-only and tools stay blocked |
| Workflow monitoring | Authenticated tenant-scoped dashboard for latest workflow outcomes, success rate, governance blocks, failures, median duration, and metadata-only run history; sample is capped at 100 records |
| Developer SDKs | Internal TypeScript, Python, and Go client foundations for workflow validation, safe preview, and gated read-only runs; not published or stable |
| Python CLI | Internal Python `qs` CLI for validation, safe preview, and gated read-only runs; not published |
| Run runtime | `@quicksilver/kernel/runtime`: durable run records, in-memory / journaled-file / PostgreSQL stores, governed priority queue with dead letters, and a worker ([details](./docs/platform/durable-runs.md)) |
| Triggers | `@quicksilver/kernel/triggers`: UTC cron scheduler and HMAC-signed webhooks, enqueued under the `trigger` role ([details](./docs/platform/triggers.md)) |
| Hosted runtime | `@quicksilver/host`: single-tenant process with management API, secrets vault, JSON logs and Prometheus metrics; Docker/Compose plus a Render deployment for health, readiness, and persistence validation ([details](./docs/platform/hosted-runtime.md)) |

## Run it locally

```bash
npm ci
npm run verify             # no external credentials required
cp .env.example .env
# Set the dedicated project in the root .env and apps/studio/.env.
# Fill the new project's API token and Context MCP endpoints in the root .env.
npm run dev:studio
npm run dev:web
```

The dedicated Sanity project is `f87t11g1`, and local project IDs now point to
it. Studio schema deployment remains pending until valid project-scoped access
is configured. Set
`QUICKSILVER_PROCESS_ENGINE=on` to run the existing Decision Lifecycle process
engine from the configured project.

To run the hosted runtime (worker, schedules, webhooks, management API), see
[hosted runtime](./docs/platform/hosted-runtime.md):

```bash
cp deploy/quicksilver.host.example.json quicksilver.host.json
npm run host -- vault keygen    # set QUICKSILVER_VAULT_KEY
npm run host -- check
npm run host
```
## Origins

Project Quicksilver was built from **Quicksilver**, the Sanity Challenge entry
**[Sanity Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges)** (Sept 18 – Oct 4, 2026) that has since
been withdrawn. That submission lives in its own repository,
**[nuerainc/quicksilver-sanity-challenge](https://github.com/nuerainc/quicksilver-sanity-challenge)**,
with its live demo, and was entered in both paths:

- **Path One**, *Ship an Agent That Queries Real Content*: Quicksilver: An Autonomous Company Operating System
- **Path Two**, *Vibe-Code Something Strange*: Quicksilver: The Company That Operates Itself

Nuera Quicksilver is the entry in its place, in both challenge paths. Copies
of the challenge documents ([submission record](./SUBMISSION.md),
[Path One post](./docs/DEV-POST-PATH-ONE.md), [Path Two post](./docs/DEV-POST-PATH-TWO.md),
[demo script](./docs/DEMO-SCRIPT.md)) are kept here for history.

**MiniMax Agent** built the architecture through hardening. **Claude Code** (via Cowork) added the Knowledge Base integration, the live reviewer, the deployment, the process engine and the live testing. The manual work was done in **VS Code**. All of it is in one unified [build log](./BUILD-LOG.md), including every real error and how it was fixed. Later Nuera Quicksilver work (regression suites, the durable run runtime) was added with Claude in Cowork. Historical challenge documents are retained for context and do not define the current platform; see the [documentation index](./docs/README.md).
