/**
 * Security headers on every page and API response (threat model T-67), and
 * the cross-site check on every state-changing API request (A-3, T-30).
 *
 * A fresh nonce per request goes into the Content-Security-Policy on both the
 * request (Next.js reads it there and stamps the nonce on its own scripts) and
 * the response. Pages must render per request for the nonce to reach them;
 * the root layout is `force-dynamic` for that reason. The policy itself and
 * the companion headers live in lib/security-headers.ts, where they are tested.
 *
 * A POST (or any other non-GET) to `/api/*` must be `application/json` and,
 * when a browser sends `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site`, come from this app's own
 * origin (lib/request-guard.ts); otherwise it is refused here, before any
 * route handler runs.
