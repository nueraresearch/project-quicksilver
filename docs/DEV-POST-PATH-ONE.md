# Quicksilver: An Autonomous Company Operating System

**A chatbot reads your documents. Quicksilver reasons over your company.**

`Structured organizational knowledge → agent reasoning → deterministic authority → recorded decision → state update`

## What I Built

Most AI business tools answer questions about your company by searching
documents. They find mentions. They confabulate when nothing matches.
Quicksilver is different: it asks the agent to query a *structured model*
of the company — entities, capabilities, policies, evidence, objectives,
workflows — and then runs the proposed action through a deterministic
authorization kernel before any state changes.

The shape of the company comes from Sanity. Ten document types carry it:
`organization`, `department`, `entity` (one abstraction for humans,
agents, robots, systems, and contractors — same shape, same reasoning),
`capability`, `policy`, `objective`, `workflow`, `evidence`, `decision`,
`metric`.

The kernel is plain TypeScript. No LLM inside it. The LLM proposes a
candidate action; the kernel decides whether the actor has the
capability, which policies apply, how the risk stacks up, and whether
the action is allowed to execute autonomously, requires human approval,
or is hard-blocked. An independent reviewer model adds a second opinion
alongside the kernel's own computation — advisory only, it never gets to
authorize or block anything.

Drop in the seed objective, *"Reduce production downtime by 20% over the
next 30 days without increasing OPEX,"* and the agent decomposes it,
identifies the relevant policies (Operations Policy 17 and Emergency
Policy 4, both in scope `production.parameter_changes`), and proposes
adjusting a CNC controller parameter by 5%. The agent pulls up the
historical-incident evidence that contradicts the parameter-adjustment
hypothesis (confidence 0.92), which Sanity's Knowledge Base also flags as
an open contradiction. The kernel's authority check flags the policy
conflict (two live policies in the same scope, priorities 5 and 7), and
risk lands at 5 of 5 (a base-4 capability plus real operational impact).
The recommendation routes to **human approval**. Approve, execute (simulated), observe a
metric move, and close the loop — the full decision record is persisted
as an auditable `decision` doc in Sanity.

**Processes are content too.** The `workflow` type isn't documentation.
It holds executable *process definitions*: states, transitions, and
structured guards like `kernel.riskLevel lte 2`, never code strings. The
kernel runs them. Every decision moves through a **Decision Lifecycle**
process stored in Sanity. The kernel takes the first automatic transition
whose guard holds (hard block → rejected, low risk → auto-approved,
everything else → a human), refuses illegal jumps with a plain-English
reason, requires a human for approve/reject/rollback, and stamps the
definition's version and `_rev` on every step in the decision's process
history. The company's autonomy ceiling is a number in a Sanity document
(`kernel.riskLevel lte 2`): an editor can tighten it in Studio and the app's
behavior follows on the next request, no redeploy. (Loosening it past the
kernel's own env threshold does nothing, on purpose: content can make the
company more careful, never less.) An invalid definition
(unreachable state, dead end, malformed guard) stops the kernel moving
anything, rather than being bypassed.

The judging question here is: *could this just have been keyword search?*
No. A keyword search finds "Engineering approval is required for
parameter changes." It doesn't find whether the policy applies vs. is
superseded or expired, whether the actor has the capability in the
company model, whether a higher-priority policy conflicts, whether
evidence contradicts the recommendation at 0.92 confidence, or what the
rollback procedure is. Quicksilver surfaces all of that *because* the
data is structured.

## Demo

**Live, deployed, click-through: https://quicksilver-seven.vercel.app**

No login required — the CEO Intent box comes pre-filled with the seed
objective. Click **SEND TO QUICKSILVER** (a real plan takes about a
minute), then scroll past the Plan paragraph to the cards under
**DECISIONS**. The planner reasons fresh on every run, so the exact cards
vary. Open **Show reasoning & evidence** on a card to see the policies
and evidence it considered, and a dashed **INDEPENDENT REVIEW** block kept
visually separate from the kernel's own risk/authority computation. On a
card with a flag count, that's the reviewer catching real gaps, like a proposal that never confirms
alignment with Operations Policy 17. Nothing there is scripted. From
there: approve, execute (simulated), and observe the metric move.

Each card also carries a **Process** line: *Decision Lifecycle v3 ·
Awaiting human approval (via route-to-human) · Next: Approve (human) ·
Reject (human) · Request more evidence (human)*. That is the kernel running a process definition read
from Sanity. A card the kernel rates low-risk (risk ≤ 2, no policy conflict,
solid evidence) arrives already approved, marked *"Auto-approved by the kernel."* If a metric moves the
wrong way after execution, you can propose, approve, and execute a
rollback, and the original decision moves to *rolled back*. If the
rollback itself fails, a human can retry it. The **Decision log →** link
(top right) shows every decision on record with its full process history:
which transition moved it, who or what took it (kernel, human, executor),
and when.

## How I Used Sanity

Sanity isn't a CMS in this build, it's the operating substrate. Ten
document types model the company, and the agent reads through **two
separate Sanity Context MCP endpoints**, since one endpoint serves one
mode:

- **GROQ mode** (`quicksilver-agent`) exposes `groq_query`,
  `schema_explorer`, and `array_field_reader` over the live dataset for
  structured queries against the current state of the company.
- **Knowledge Base mode** (`quicksilver-knowledge-base`) serves a real
  Sanity Knowledge Base built from the `evidence` and `policy` document
  types, with the `contradicts[]` reference field unfolded so a target
  claim's text and confidence are inlined rather than just linked.
  Sanity's own build pipeline organized this into cited entries and —
  unprompted — flagged the central parameter-drift-vs-mechanical-failure
  conflict as a pending contradiction for human review. That detection is
  a platform feature; nothing about it was hand-built.

The agent's tool set merges both endpoints (`packages/agent/src/mcp.ts`,
aliasing the `initial_context` tool name collision between them to
`kb_initial_context`), and `npm run verify:mcp` exercises both live,
including a real `knowledge_base_read` call.

Sanity also holds the company's **processes**. The two `workflow`
documents are process definitions with structured guards, edited in
Studio like any other content. The **Decision Lifecycle** (8 states, 12
transitions) is read by the kernel on every decision state change; the
Production Parameter Change process is declared and validated the same
way, ready for a route to drive it. Round-tripping
them to and from Sanity's typed fields is covered by the kernel's tests,
so what's in Content Lake is exactly what the kernel runs.

**Proven live, not just in tests.** Before submitting, I stress-tested the
deployed site against the production dataset. Every status change went
through the Sanity-stored process. Two simultaneous approvals of the same
decision gave exactly one success and one clean refusal. A guard added to
the process in Content Lake took effect on the very next request, with no
redeploy. A deliberately broken definition made the kernel refuse every
transition until it was restored (17 of 17 governance checks passed). The
same run found real problems, including a risk formula that scored nearly
everything 5/5; all of them are fixed, and the fixes are in the build log.
Then an automated live test (`npm run e2e:live`) drove the two paths that
are hardest to trigger by hand, against production: decisions held while
the process definition was broken, then resumed once it was fixed; and a
rollback that fails, is retried, and succeeds. **44 of 44 checks passed.**

Writes go through `@sanity/client` mutations against the HTTP API
(Context MCP is read-only) — every plan run persists a `decision`
document with the question, the evidence and policies considered, the
kernel's risk/authority computation, and now the independent reviewer's
notes too, so a judge can see *why* a decision was made without exposing
raw LLM scratch space.

## Agent Session

The full day-by-day build history — every environment, every real error
hit and how it was fixed, the final file inventory, and the exact handoff
points between them — lives in one unified log:
[`BUILD-LOG.md`](https://github.com/nuerainc/quicksilver-sanity-challenge/blob/main/BUILD-LOG.md).
Short version: **MiniMax Agent** built the architecture-through-hardening
pass end to end (schema lock, kernel, agent harness, the full Next.js app,
seed data with the deliberate policy conflict, first submission drafts);
**Claude Code** (via Cowork) then took it the rest of the way — the real
Knowledge Base Context MCP integration, the independent reviewer wired
into the live `/api/plan` route, real bugs found and fixed (a kernel
risk-tier edge case, and the same strict-JSON-schema mistake three times,
now guarded by a test), the live Vercel deployment, the Sanity Workflows bonus,
the kernel's process engine that runs Sanity-stored process definitions,
and a live stress test of the deployed site that led to a recalibrated
risk formula and a new version of the Decision Lifecycle, plus an
automated live test (44/44) of its hardest paths.
