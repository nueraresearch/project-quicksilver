# Nuera Quicksilver implementation roadmap

This roadmap maps the enterprise cognitive and platform goals to the existing
Quicksilver repository. Work extends the current kernel, agents, workflows, and
Sanity audit model; it does not replace them.

The target has twelve principles: cognitive integrity, safety, auditability,
closed-loop learning, domain intelligence, multi-model optimization, developer
experience, workflow orchestration, hosted runtime reliability, secrets and
RBAC security, observability, and an extensible SDK/plugin ecosystem.

## Product target

The destination is set by the [product definition](NUERA-QUICKSILVER-PRODUCT.md):
an intent-driven company operating system with a platform foundation and three
loop layers, running in three modes (Genesis, Onboard, Operate). The platform
work below builds the Foundation and Layer 1. The product track adds Layers 2
and 3.

| Milestone | Version | Delivers | Layer | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1: Governance foundation | 0.2.0 | Kernel, evaluation, approval binding, RBAC, durable runs, triggers, separation of duties, persisted evaluations | Foundation, 1 | **Complete 2026-09-25** |
| M2: Single-tenant host | 0.3.0 | Host process, management API, secrets vault, structured logs and metrics, deploy config ([hosted runtime](platform/hosted-runtime.md)) | Foundation | **Complete 2026-09-26**; local-host foundation, later validated in a single-tenant Render deployment under M5 |
| M3: Intent layer | 0.4.0 | Decision graph, provenance tags, impact scoring for open unknowns, the intent entry point, belief updates through the memory governor | 2 | M1; Aura. **Complete 2026-09-26** on built features ([Aura README](../packages/aura/README.md)); Aura's 70% choice-agreement target stays on Aura's own charter ladder |
| M4: Playbooks and Onboard pilot | 0.5.0 | `playbook` type (process definition plus stage graphs), Onboard playbook, connectors, backtest and shadow mode, a pilot on Nuera (on the local host) | 3 | M2, M3 |
| M5: Genesis demonstration | 0.6.0 | Economic playbook, `experiment` and `ledgerEntry` types, WAES review in the kernel path, a small-budget spend risk scale, always-on hosting (moved from M2); a $500, 30-day digital-only run | 3 | M3, M4. **Built 2026-09-26** ([Genesis run](platform/genesis-run.md), [always-on hosting](platform/always-on-hosting.md)); the run waits on the entity decision and payment accounts |
| M6: Operate | 0.7.0 | Steady-state operations, reinvestment, and bounded Genesis experiments inside a running business | 3 | M4, M5. **Built 2026-09-27** ([Operate](platform/operate.md)); operation starts after M4's pilot and M5's run |
| M7: Kernel depth | 0.8.0 | Policy versioning, supersession and scope nesting; capability graph (inheritance, dependencies, conflicts, risk multipliers); what-if simulation (Monte Carlo, counterfactuals on shadow logs); a governed task interface for other Nuera projects | Foundation, 1 | M6. **All four parts built 2026-09-27** ([Kernel depth](platform/kernel-depth.md), [What-if engine](platform/what-if.md), [Task interface](platform/tasks.md)): policy versioning, supersession and scope nesting; the capability graph; what-if simulation (Monte Carlo cash, experiment odds, stress scenarios, counterfactuals on shadow logs; estimates, never decisions); the governed task interface (one intake for HTTP API, MCP, webhook and CLI tasks through the kernel's `authorize()`; the channel grants nothing, humans approve) |
| **M8: Enterprise feature-complete release candidate** | **0.9.0** | All enterprise capability tracks: Supervisor Agent control plane, complete agent family, evaluator calibration, workflow publishing and bounded loops, hosted/scalable runtime, SDKs and CLI, SSO/OIDC, multi-tenancy, durable audit, traces/dashboards, extension runtime, marketplace foundations, signed domain packs, compliance evidence workflows, and Genesis/Onboard/Operate integration | Foundation, 1, 2, 3 | M7. Build target; feature-complete release candidate, not yet 1.0.0 |
| **M9: Enterprise hardening and complete release** | **1.0.0** | Full integration and failure-path closure, security/compliance review, penetration testing, operational evidence, parity closure, marketplace/domain-pack evidence, three-mode evidence, backup/restore and rollback drills, stable API/SDK release, and production hand-off | M8 | **All new enterprise features complete by M9**; publish 1.0.0 only after evidence review |

**Versioning:** the verified milestone baseline is 0.8.0 (Nuera RDL versioning standard): M1 through M7 are implementation-complete, with M7 verified by [M7 release evidence](platform/m7-release-evidence.md). Each milestone raises the minor version: M4 → 0.5.0, M5 → 0.6.0, M6 → 0.7.0, M7 (kernel depth) → 0.8.0, M8 → 0.9.0 release candidate, and M9 → 1.0.0 after operational evidence. The complete M8–M9 delivery contract is in [M8–M9 enterprise plan](M8-M9-ENTERPRISE-PLAN.md).
The M2 host retains a local-first mode. M5 now also has a single-tenant Render deployment validated for health, readiness, and persistence wiring; that evidence does not close the mode pilots, external-provider, or multi-tenant release gates.

**M3 released as 0.4.0 (2026-09-26), decoupled from Aura's choice target.**

- Quicksilver's safety never depended on Aura. The kernel, RBAC and
  human-only transitions govern every action.
- Autonomy is gated per department in two ways:
  - by shadow-mode agreement, measured on the owner's own verdicts
  - by the provider's own autonomy entry in the intent ledger
- Aura's 70% choice-agreement criterion remains the bar for **Aura 0.1.0 and
  above**. It is not a bar for this release.
- No department acts alone without evidence: 20+ judged recommendations,
  80%+ agreement and no bad outcomes, and then the provider's own hand-over.

`packages/aura` has:

- the provenance-tagged decision graph, validation, impact scoring and targeted questions
- governed belief updates and the intent entry point
- a rule-based baseline parser (80.8% on 52 labeled objectives) and a
  model-based parser on Azure (agent `nuera-quicksilver:intent`, grounded quotes only)
- the **intent ledger** from the revised Aura charter:
  - intent providers (person, group or organization) and admins
  - goals with time horizons
  - per-provider weights and autonomy
  - decision rules and customer commitments
  - a hash-chained, optionally signed log of every change, checked through
    kernel RBAC (`intent:provide`, `intent:rules`)
- persistence: append-only file and Sanity stores for the ledger, verified on
  every load, and Studio schemas `intentLedgerEntry` and `intentGraph`

Choice agreement (the primary criterion, target 70%): predictor v1 scored 6/38 (15.8%, below 25% chance). The blind Azure model test scored 24/38 (63.2%) without the profile and 23/38 (60.5%) with it: past 2× chance, short of 70%. The frozen v2 method (the model's pick plus a learner) scored 10/30 (33.3%) on 30 fresh scenarios, and the model alone 7/30 (23.3%): the 63% did not replicate. Not met. The next test is shadow-mode verdicts in the pilot. The first impact-ranking test scored 56.3% (below the 63% chance rate); the
revised charter makes choice agreement the primary measure. Calibration now
starts from a 36-item intent profile (six dimensions, consistency checks, red
lines). The 38 blind choice scenarios test whether Aura can predict the
founder's choices from that profile.

Built since the M3 start:

- implied-intent parsing ("we run a feed store" settles the business type)
- the production parser, which reached 27/30 (90.0%) on the held-out set
- the web entry point: the host console at `/console`
- the choice predictors:
  - frozen v1 (failed)
  - a learning predictor (exploratory)
  - a verdict learner that Aura scores predict-then-learn during the pilot

**M4 build progress (2026-09-26):**

- Playbook type in the kernel, validated as data only: capabilities per step, fixed kill/hold/scale thresholds, human-and-not-author publishing, runs pinned to the content digest.
- The Onboard playbook (`deploy/playbooks/onboard.json`).
- A read-only CSV ledger connector with the AMP boundary.
- Revenue back-testing.
- Shadow mode, which never executes; hand-over is the founder's own ledger entry.
- `npm run onboard` commands and the [pilot runbook](platform/onboard-pilot.md).
- Shadow mode on the host API:
  - The shadow-stage agent (`nuera-quicksilver:shadow`) proposes grounded
    actions, each evaluated by the kernel as if the department had been
    handed over.
  - Aura records a prediction before each verdict and learns from the
    verdict. Pilot verdicts become the fresh, predict-then-learn test of
    choice agreement.
- Still to come:
  - live connectors (bookkeeping, payments, CRM, email), which need the founder's credentials in the vault
  - the pilot itself, Jan–Feb 2027, then 0.5.0

**M5 build (2026-09-26):**

- The economic playbook (`deploy/playbooks/genesis.json`): observe →
  hypothesize → experiment → measure → update beliefs → allocate →
  expand, modify or kill.
  - Kill is automatic.
  - Starting, scaling and modifying are the founder's.
- The `experiment` type:
  - hypothesis, metric, thresholds, budget and duration are fixed when a
    human starts it
  - the digest is pinned
  - every measurement needs a source
- The money ledger (`ledgerEntry`): spend, compute, revenue and refunds in a
  hash chain, each with a source. Compute is costed as capital.
- The small-budget spend risk scale, measured against what is left.
  - Spend decisions refuse prohibited categories, overspend and the daily
    cap.
  - Above $10, above risk 2, or outside an experiment, the founder decides.
- The WAES gate in `authorize()`: a customer-facing action is hard-blocked
  unless a WAES review passed that exact content, from a separate reviewer.
- Always-on hosting templates (Render blueprint; VPS with Caddy TLS) and docs.
  The Render topology is deployed for health, readiness, and persistence-wiring
  validation; see [Render operational evidence](platform/render-operational-evidence-2026-10-05.md).
- The $500, 30-day run config and `npm run genesis` commands.
- `check` lists what blocks the run:
  - an approved entity
  - payment accounts in the vault
- Versions: 0.5.0 follows the Onboard pilot's evidence; 0.6.0 follows the
  Genesis run's.

**Carried into M3 (found by the first live host run, 2026-09-26):**
- Done: the seed policies now carry structured effects (`apps/studio/seed/policies.ts`, tested by `npm run seed:test`):
  - Ops 17 requires approval.
  - Emergency 4 allows changes up to risk 2, only when `incident.classification` is `emergency`. Because it loosens Ops 17, the kernel still routes those changes to a human.
  - Budget 3 requires approval above $50,000, and also when the exposure is unknown.
  - The kernel now passes `action.financialExposure` as a fact.
  - Re-seed `f87t11g1` with `npm run seed` to apply them live.
- The seed decision predates `requestedBy` and `proposedBy`; decisions created
  since M1 carry both.
0.9.0 is the release candidate, when all three modes pass the parity gate in
testing. **1.0.0 requires all three modes (Genesis, Onboard, Operate) to pass the
parity gate with operational evidence.** See the
[product definition](NUERA-QUICKSILVER-PRODUCT.md#81-versioning).
The 0.9.0 gate is tracked as pass/fail requirements in [parity tests](platform/parity-tests.md), and its security prerequisites in the [threat model](platform/threat-model.md).

Product-track rules: Layers 2 and 3 never gain authority. Every playbook step
is a proposal through the NQC Kernel. Belief updates can only change
`AGENT_INFERRED` values. Customer-facing proposals need a passing WAES review
as evidence.

## Existing foundation to preserve

- `packages/kernel` already provides deterministic capability, policy, risk,
  approval, and process governance. Its existing tests remain the regression
  baseline.
- `packages/agent` already provides model configuration, a Sanity MCP planner,
  and an advisory reviewer.
- `apps/web` already provides the objective console and decision APIs for
  approval, simulated execution, observation, rollback, and resume.
- `apps/studio` already provides the company schemas and the versioned Decision
  Lifecycle definition. Decision and process history are persisted in Sanity.

## Current NQC additions

The new `packages/kernel/src/engine`, `packages/kernel/src/nqc`, `packages/kernel/src/tools`, and `packages/kernel/src/workflows` folders add
deterministic evaluation signals plus a bounded, provider-neutral reasoning
stress challenge generator/scorer, NQC escalation around existing authorization,
a versioned tool-contract registry used by the shared Sanity Context MCP dispatch path, a static versioned workflow-graph validator, an in-browser workflow draft builder and validation API, route
selection and performance-update functions, and governed memory-write
proposals. Evaluation and safety results are returned by the live plan path and
added to the Sanity decision schema. Query responses also include evaluation
signals, and their MCP calls pass through the same validator.

The kernel also contains a versioned Nuera Quicksilver Agent manifest
registry. Planner, reviewer, and query model calls check that their identity and
task are registered before dispatch. Manifests describe policy; they do not
grant agents authority to approve or execute actions.

The agent package now defines a shared versioned worker request/result
contract. The existing read-only query worker is adapted to it and runs through
Quicksilver Engine/NQC evaluation before returning to the live workflow runner.
Planner and reviewer calls now run through the same contract
(`plannerQuicksilverAgent`, `reviewerQuicksilverAgent`), so each call is
evaluated. A planner evaluation that is not ALLOW sends every proposed action
to a human (`applyUpstreamEscalation`).

The workflow package also includes an in-process DAG runner with injected
agent/tool/evaluator/approval handlers. Configured agent attempts retry with
bounded backoff; configured handler timeouts send abort signals, including to
the live read-only query model call. Tool calls are never automatically
retried. Independent low/moderate-impact agent steps support opt-in bounded
request-local concurrency; the live route caps concurrent query steps at
three. It is not connected to a hosted worker, web-builder execution, shared
storage, or durable run history. High-impact and side-effect tools are
evaluated and approved before dispatch.

These additions are not yet a complete evaluator or hosted platform. Current
evaluation checks observable grounding and tool signals; it does not prove
semantic correctness or perform adversarial reasoning stress tests. Routing
needs persisted, measured model profiles and is not yet connected to planner
dispatch.
Memory decisions are policy helpers and proposals; a persistent memory store,
retrieval path, retention job, and domain isolation are still needed. Tool
validation now wraps the existing Sanity Context MCP execution path, but
multi-step dependencies and verified approval for effectful integrations still
need to be connected. Query and workflow evaluations are stored as
`evaluationRecord` documents, and responses report whether the audit write
succeeded.

## Gap analysis against the enterprise specification

The detailed requirement-by-requirement tracker, including the expanded
workflow, runtime, ecosystem, observability, compliance, and tenant requirements,
is the [blueprint coverage document](NUERA-QUICKSILVER-SPEC-COVERAGE.md).

The labels below describe repository evidence today; they are not product
readiness claims.

| Specification area | Repository evidence | Gap and dependency | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cognitive evaluation | Deterministic signals score supplied grounding, tool failures, uncertainty, and plan length; NQC returns scores and safety outcomes; Quicksilver Engine has a seeded final-answer stress harness | Semantic correctness and calibrated hallucination/brittleness baselines are not established; see the [benchmark plan](NQC-EVALUATION-BENCHMARK.md); do not infer comparative performance from stress-suite scores | Partial foundation |
| Safety and governance | Existing Sanity decision lifecycle now requires a server-verified configured human supervisor for decision actions, stores policy snapshot and action fingerprints, and records execution outcomes; workflow tool dispatch remains blocked in web live runs | Replace interim single-token identity with authenticated sessions/SSO and RBAC; add durable external-tool approval records and end-to-end authorization | Partial foundation |
| Agents and orchestration | Versioned manifests gate planner, reviewer, and query calls; governed agent-definition catalog has tenant-scoped immutable releases, dedicated RBAC, audited rollback drafts, and mandatory independent review; workflow DAG contract and in-process runner support branch evaluation | Catalog definitions remain metadata-only; remaining agent family is not implemented; no bounded concurrent scheduler, durable jobs, cancellation propagation for every provider, queue/backpressure, or dead-letter processing | Partial foundation |
| Workflow builder and release lifecycle | Browser graph editor, validation, JSON import/export, local autosave, safe preview, retry/timeout fields, immutable published versions, independent author/reviewer/publisher gates, mandatory reviewer rationale, safety-aware diffs, rollback, append-only audit, and digest-pinned run snapshots through the single-tenant host; host restart now rejects persisted graph/digest or lifecycle inconsistencies | Web live execution remains development-only; hosted publishing stores are not shared with the host; no scheduled deployment, isolated job containers, or effectful tools | Partial foundation |
| Routing optimization | Deterministic route-selection and profile-update helpers exist | No measured/persisted model profiles, route decision history, or connection to actual planner selection | Not operational |
| Memory and learning | Memory-write governance proposal and retention metadata helpers | No tenant/domain-scoped persistent store, retrieval, provenance lifecycle, deletion, feedback loop, or validated improvement evidence | Not operational |
| Tool/plugin ecosystem | Versioned in-process tool contracts validate the current Sanity MCP path | No persistent catalog, general plugin install/permission system, hosted tool runtime, marketplace, or externally verifiable approvals | Partial foundation |
| SDK and developer experience | Internal TypeScript, Python/CLI, and dependency-free Go client foundations cover validate, preview, and gated read-only run | No stable/published API, agent creation API, docs portal, or compatibility guarantees | Partial foundation |
| Hosted runtime and triggers | Durable run records; in-memory, journaled-file, and PostgreSQL stores; governed priority queue; worker; cron and signed webhooks; single-tenant host process with management API, graceful shutdown, Docker and Compose config; Render health/readiness and persistence-wiring validation | Isolated execution per job, shared replay cache for replicas, multi-tenant hosting, and a post-PR #88 live persistence check | Single-tenant foundation |
| Identity, tenancy, and secrets | Kernel RBAC with tenant isolation, agent-authority bar and audited decisions; dedicated agent catalog read/write/review/publish permissions; hashed per-person bearer tokens on the queue, web and host; browser OIDC authorization-code/PKCE, signed-token validation, sessions, mapping and revocation; encrypted secrets vault with RBAC, rotation and audit | Console sign-in control, post-deploy session evidence, persistent principal/role administration, durable access-audit store, and team collaboration remain open | Partial foundation |
| Monitoring and audit | Decision and process history, durable run records and evaluation records; structured JSON logs with secret redaction; Prometheus metrics for runs, queue, webhooks, schedules, evaluations, vault and HTTP; authenticated tenant-scoped workflow and trace dashboards over bounded metadata history | Host queue/schedule/webhook traces, external alert delivery, complete history, provider-cost reconciliation, and retention remain open | Partial foundation |
| Enterprise deployment and extensions | Separate Studio schemas are prepared; canonical docs and roadmap are separated from challenge history | Dedicated Sanity project ID and Context MCP endpoints are pending; compliance packs, identity-provider integration, team collaboration, and governed extension releases are absent | Blocked / not built |
| Domain kernels | Task labels and shared kernel contracts provide extension points | Repo, hydraulic, compliance, security, and finance domain rules, evidence sources, and domain-specific evaluation are not implemented | Not built |

### Recommended closure order

1. **Preserve and regression-lock the existing foundation:** land the local
   agent catalog RBAC and safe rollback-to-draft work with focused tests; keep
   challenge data isolated from the new Studio project.
2. **Close Gate 0 explicitly:** preserve the approved P-001–P-123 v1.0.0
   baseline in [`V1-SCOPE.md`](V1-SCOPE.md), complete remaining operational
   decisions, and track parity evidence separately from operational readiness.
3. **Prove one connected workflow path:** publisher → immutable version → host
   admission → durable run → read-only query → NQC evaluation → metadata audit
   and monitoring. Runs pin the admitted digest; persisted graph/digest
   inconsistencies fail closed on restart. Tools remain blocked.
4. **Measure cognitive behavior:** implement the versioned, labeled,
   held-out benchmark in [`NQC-EVALUATION-BENCHMARK.md`](NQC-EVALUATION-BENCHMARK.md)
   before making correctness, calibration, or comparison claims.
5. **Then expand platform breadth:** stable SDK contracts and hosted isolation
   precede executable plugins; marketplace breadth follows signed, revocable
   extension lifecycle and the secured runtime. M9 enterprise scope remains.

## Platform feature status

| Platform capability | Current state |
|---|---|
| Workflow execution | Drafts autosave locally; safe preview is available; opt-in web live path supports read-only query-agent nodes through NQC evaluation. The host runs configured workflows from its durable queue, schedules and signed webhooks; published runs resolve to immutable versions and write metadata-only history. Tools remain blocked, and the web/host publication stores are not yet one integrated service |
| Agent runtime | Planner, reviewer, and query calls use registered versioned manifests and the standard agent contract; the host runs query agents in a worker pool over the durable queue; tools stay blocked |
| Tools and integrations | Versioned per-request tool registry wired to Sanity Context MCP; no persistent plugin catalog or marketplace |
| Developer experience | Internal TypeScript, Python/CLI, and dependency-free Go SDK foundations for workflow validation, safe preview, and opt-in read-only runs; none is published as a stable API. No agent creation API |
| Identity and secrets | NQC RBAC and hashed per-person tokens (`QUICKSILVER_PRINCIPALS`) for supervisor actions, queue operations and the host API; encrypted secrets vault; browser OIDC/PKCE and server-side sessions, without a console sign-in control or persistent administration UI |
| Monitoring | Decision log, process history, structured logs and Prometheus metrics on the host; authenticated metadata-only trace and workflow dashboards, without full host trace coverage, external alerts, or provider-cost reconciliation |
| Triggers and resilience | Cron schedules and signed webhooks run in the host process from configuration, enqueue through the governed queue, and rotate secrets without a restart; no event-bus trigger |
| Collaboration and release | Git/process versions exist; no team workspace, approval roles, or workflow deployment pipeline |

## Build sequence

### 1. Finish the governance path

- Route every external tool invocation, including future non-Sanity providers,
  through the NQC validator and require verified supervisor approval for
  effectful calls.
- Add explicit supervisor approval for side effects, merges, deployments,
  configuration changes, and policy or routing updates.
- Persist approval and execution events with actor, policy version, request ID,
  and outcome in the existing audit trail.
- Decision-plan approval now extends the existing Sanity decision and process
  history: a server-verified human supervisor approves the exact action bound
  to the policy document revisions; execution rechecks that binding and
  appends its outcome. This remains an interim single-supervisor credential,
  not a general external-tool approval service.
- Add evaluated multi-step scenarios, contradiction checks, and correction
  retries with bounded attempts and clear stop conditions.

### 2. Make routing and memory operational

- Collect per-model cost, latency, task quality, failure, and rate-limit
  outcomes; persist versioned profiles and route decisions.
- Feed measured profiles into the new route selector and use its fallbacks in
  the actual agent runtime.
- Add a tenant- and domain-scoped memory store with retention, provenance,
  access policy, approval, and deletion support.
- Store failure exemplars only after the memory governor approves them; use
  retrieved memories as evidence with provenance, never as authority.

### 3. Add governed orchestration

- Extend the planner, reviewer, and query manifests with versioned capabilities,
  tool schemas, and execution permissions for the full Nuera Quicksilver Agents
  family.
- Connect the in-process graph runner to an orchestration runtime with
  concurrency limits, retries, timeouts, cancellation, backpressure, and
  dead-letter handling.
- Add event, webhook, and scheduled triggers. Keep every resulting action
  behind the NQC decision gate.
- Promote the existing process definition into a visual workflow builder while
  retaining the deterministic process engine as the runtime authority.

### 4. Build the developer and platform layer

- Stabilize and publish the existing TypeScript and Python SDKs, then add Go;
  evolve the `qs` CLI and versioned plugin/tool contracts alongside the API.
- Add hosted agent and tool execution with isolated jobs and resource limits.
- Add agent/workflow creation UI, versioned deployments, team collaboration,
  and a reviewed extension catalog.
- Add centralized monitoring for runs, decisions, tool calls, model usage,
  latency, costs, failures, and traces.

### 5. Meet enterprise deployment requirements

- Implement authentication, RBAC, tenant isolation, managed credentials,
  secrets rotation, and auditable administrative actions before shared hosted
  execution.
- Add policy packs, retention controls, exportable audit evidence, compliance
  reporting, and identity-provider integration.
- Add domain kernels for repo, hydraulic, and compliance work behind shared NQC
  safety and audit contracts.

### 6. Close the platform ecosystem gap

- Harden and publish versioned JavaScript and Python SDKs, then add Go, a stable
  agent creation API, and broader CLI workflows.
- Provide a workflow/automation graph UI backed by the existing deterministic
  process engine, with branching, parallel nodes, triggers, and versioned
  releases.
- Build an isolated hosted runtime with queues, cancellation, retries,
  backpressure, rate-limit controls, and dead-letter handling.
- Add team workspaces, collaboration, RBAC, tenant isolation, and an audited
  secrets vault before opening hosted execution to customers.
- Add logs, metrics, traces, performance dashboards, and a governed extension
  catalog for tools, agents, and domain kernels.

## Completion standard

Do not describe a capability as complete until it is connected to its runtime
path, its decisions are auditable, failure behavior is defined, and the existing
kernel/agent regression suites cover the new behavior. Product comparisons and
enterprise readiness claims require evidence from implemented features and
operational validation, not this roadmap alone.

## Sanity and documentation boundary

The original Quicksilver Sanity Challenge environment (`d280bqjc` /
`production`) contains the tested baseline and historical challenge material.
The dedicated Nuera Quicksilver project (`f87t11g1`) now exists, its
`production` dataset is private, and local app/Studio IDs point to it. Do not
deploy schemas or seed data until the new project-scoped server token and
Context MCP endpoints are configured.

Keep challenge writeups as historical/reference material. Canonical cognitive
and platform docs now have separate homes under `docs/nqc/` and
`docs/platform/`, linked from `docs/README.md`. Avoid rewriting historical
claims as current product capabilities.

## M8–M9 UI adoption track

Production operator UX adopted from the frontend reference without importing its simulated data or side effects:

- Telemetry KPI cards and freshness/provenance labels in `/monitoring` and `/monitoring/traces`.
- Execution traces and artifact views in `/workflows` and `/agents`, backed by real run IDs, digests, evaluation results, safety decisions, and requester identity.
- Filterable entity cards and permission-aware detail views in `/entities`.
- Truthful chat starter prompts, artifact export, and message telemetry.
- Evidence-backed benchmark and workload views with reproducibility metadata.
- Responsive, accessible visual polish while preserving route authentication, deep links, unavailable states, and kernel governance.

M8 builds and integrates these surfaces; M9 hardens them and publishes operational evidence. No UI may represent a simulated external side effect as completed.
