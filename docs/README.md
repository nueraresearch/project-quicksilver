# Nuera Quicksilver documentation

Nuera Quicksilver (this repository, `nuerainc/project-quicksilver`) was inspired
by Quicksilver, our Sanity Challenge 2026 submission, which lives separately at
[nuerainc/quicksilver-sanity-challenge](https://github.com/nuerainc/quicksilver-sanity-challenge).

Copies of the challenge submission, DEV posts, and demo script are kept here as
historical records, each marked with a banner. They do not describe the new platform's current capability
or deployment environment.

For a first contribution, start with the [repository README](../README.md), then
run `npm run verify` and read the [contributor guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
