# Operator memory (M8 part 2)

The Operator keeps two distinct stores under `.qs-memory/`:

- `memory.json` is the governed memory book: short notes, user profile facts,
  provenance, expiry, and its metadata audit history.
- `runs/` and `recall.sqlite` are the session archive and full-text index.
  Exporting a memory book does not export or delete archived transcripts.

## Write and review rules

Human-stated profile values become active immediately and cannot be replaced
or forgotten by the agent. Agent-inferred profile values remain pending until a
person approves them. Agent notes become active immediately. New values reject
common credential, private-key, government-ID, and payment-card patterns; each
entry is limited to 500 characters and at most 3,650 retention days. The
default retention is 365 days.

Replacing an inferred note preserves the old version as superseded, links both
versions, and excludes the old value from the active prompt snapshot. Snapshots
include the memory ID, sensitivity label, source citation, provenance hash,
confidence, and expiry. The agent sees active, unexpired entries only when the
retrieval policy permits their sensitivity. `standard` entries are included
by default. Text classified as health or financial is labeled `sensitive` and
excluded from the default agent snapshot; a trusted caller must explicitly
raise the snapshot ceiling. Callers may make a label stricter, but cannot
weaken the automatic classifier. Legacy entries are conservatively classified
when read. This topic classifier is a safeguard, not a complete personal-data
detector. Expiry redacts the text while
retaining the content digest and metadata event. A legal hold blocks removal
and expiry purge until a reviewer releases it.

## Audit, effectiveness, backup, and restore

Every memory lifecycle event is appended to a SHA-256 hash chain. Event records
contain IDs, actors, timestamps, outcomes, and content digests, but not memory
text. On reopen, the store verifies event sequencing, chain links, memory
content hashes, and provenance hashes. This detects accidental edits and
unsophisticated tampering. It is not a signature or protection from a
privileged writer who can rewrite the file and recompute the chain.

`MemoryBook.recordEffectiveness(id, outcome, reviewerId)` records one explicit
`useful`, `stale`, or `harmful` signal per reviewer and memory version. Counts
are derived from verified audit events on read. The storage method is an
internal API; callers must authenticate and authorize reviewers. The Operator
CLI now requires an authenticated human principal with `memory:approve` for
memory review, feedback, export, restore, and stated-memory writes.

`MemoryBook.exportData()` creates an integrity-checked portable bundle. It
contains plaintext memory and must be protected as sensitive data. The digest
detects accidental edits; it is not an authenticity signature. Restore verifies
the bundle, content policy, provenance, and creation-event binding, and only
imports into an empty book. It appends a restore event after the imported audit
head rather than replacing an existing memory book.

```ts
const backup = await source.exportData()
await target.restore(backup, authorizedReviewerId)
```

The CLI reads principals from `QUICKSILVER_PRINCIPALS` and the operator's raw
bearer token from `QUICKSILVER_OPERATOR_TOKEN`; every allow or deny is written
to the workspace's hash-chained `.qs-audit/operator.jsonl` before the operation
continues. Missing, invalid, non-human, cross-tenant, or underprivileged
credentials are denied. The lower-level `MemoryBook` methods remain an
internal storage API and must only be exposed through an authorized caller.
There is not yet an authenticated web memory surface. Remaining gaps include
encryption-at-rest, domain labels, source-decision existence validation, and
tenant-aware memory administration. Per-person directories encode the exact UTF-8 identity as base64url,
so distinct IDs cannot collide through lossy sanitization. Simple legacy IDs
are moved automatically when the destination is empty. Legacy paths produced
from punctuation-bearing IDs may be ambiguous; the operator refuses to use
memory for that identity until an owner reviews and resolves the old data.

Mutations to one canonical memory file are serialized across local processes
with an atomic directory lock. Lock acquisition waits up to 30 seconds and
reclaims locks older than ten minutes. This is local-filesystem coordination;
network filesystems and multi-host locking are not established. P-018 remains
partial until source-decision validation, an authenticated product memory
surface, and the remaining memory capabilities are closed.

Regression coverage is in `packages/operator/src/operator.test.ts` under the
`memory:` cases and in `packages/operator/src/setup.test.ts` for namespace
isolation and migration. Run the Operator suite with:

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings --test packages/operator/src/operator.test.ts
```

## Governed agent recall (2026-10-06)

`executeGovernedAgent` may inject a bounded recall set into the worker's context
when a `MemoryStore` is supplied. Only `failure-exemplar` and `domain-pattern`
entries are eligible; behavior-changing `routing-rule`, `safety-constraint`,
`agent-profile`, and `model-profile` entries are excluded. The injected block is
explicitly labeled advisory, includes the memory id, source, domain, and
confidence, and is not treated as authorization evidence. `recallMemory.limit`
is capped at 16 (default 8). The NQC evaluation sees the same context fallback
so the recorded evaluation cannot silently omit the recalled material.

Regression coverage: `packages/agent/src/contracts.test.ts` —
`governed recall is injected as bounded advisory context, never as authority`.
The Windows execution device used for this tranche had neither `node` nor
`npm` on PATH, so the focused test and workspace typecheck still need to be run
in a Node-enabled checkout.
