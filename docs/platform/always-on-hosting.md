# Always-on hosting (M5)

M2 runs the host on the founder's computer. That is enough for the Onboard
pilot. The Genesis run needs the host up day and night, because payment
providers send webhooks to a public address. None is deployed yet: that
waits on the entity decision and the payment accounts.

**Chosen path: Azure**, using the founder's Azure free credits, host on
**Azure App Service (Web App for Containers)** with **Azure Database for
PostgreSQL – Flexible Server** as the managed Postgres. This is the closest
Azure analog to the Render option below (least operations work; the
platform handles TLS, restarts and a managed Postgres), and it runs the
repo's existing `deploy/Dockerfile.host` image as-is rather than requiring a
different build. The Azure deploy template (the `render.yaml` equivalent) is
`deploy/azure/main.bicep`; see [Azure](azure-deploy.md). It compiles but has never been applied.

## Choose one

| Option | Files | Good for | Rough cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Azure App Service (Web App for Containers) + Azure Database for PostgreSQL | `deploy/azure/main.bicep` (compiled, never applied) | **Chosen path.** Least operations work on free Azure credits; managed Postgres, TLS and restarts | Covered by Azure free credits initially; check current App Service + Flexible Server tier prices before they run out |
| Render (managed) | `deploy/render.yaml` | Documented fallback; not the current plan | A starter web service, a small Postgres and a 1 GB disk; check Render's current prices |
| Any small VPS | `deploy/docker-compose.yml` + `deploy/docker-compose.public.yml` | Full control; Caddy handles TLS | A small VPS |
| Founder's computer (today) | `deploy/quicksilver.local.example.json` | Onboard pilot | None; no public webhooks |

Hosting is compute, so its cost is **capital** in the Genesis money ledger
(`kind: compute`, `category: hosting`), charged against the $500 budget.

## Render (documented fallback, not the current plan)

1. In Render, create a Blueprint from this repository with the blueprint
   path `deploy/render.yaml`. The service has `autoDeploy: false`, so
   nothing deploys until you choose to.
2. Add the host config as a **secret file** named `quicksilver.host.json`.
   Start from `deploy/quicksilver.host.example.json` and set
   `http.host: "0.0.0.0"`, `http.port: 8787` and `store.kind: "postgres"`.
3. Enter each `sync: false` value in the dashboard. Generate the vault key
   locally (`npm run host -- vault keygen`) and paste it there; it never
   enters the repository.
4. Deploy. Check `/healthz` and `/readyz`, then `GET /api/whoami` with your
   token.
5. Payment webhooks go to `https://<service>.onrender.com/webhooks/<id>`.
   Their signing secrets live in the vault (`vault:<name>`).

## VPS with Docker

```bash
cp deploy/quicksilver.host.example.json deploy/quicksilver.host.json   # edit
export QUICKSILVER_DOMAIN=host.example.com      # DNS A record → the server
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.public.yml up -d --build
```

Caddy gets and renews the certificate. The host is reachable only through
Caddy. The file store and vault live in the `hostdata` volume, and runs live
in Postgres.

## Before going public

- **Principals:** keep human tokens in `QUICKSILVER_PRINCIPALS`, and give
  agents the `agent-worker` role only.
- **Metrics:** leave `http.metricsPublic` off. Metrics then need `audit:read`.
- **Backups:** back up the Postgres database, the `/data` volume (vault file,
  intent data, money ledger) and the vault key, each separately.
- **Console:** `/console` is served when the intent API is on. It holds no
  data, and every call uses the viewer's own token.
- **Customer-facing text:** nothing customer-facing goes out without a
  passing review of the exact text. Until WAES runs as a service, the
  founder reviews it himself (`npm run genesis -- review`, or the console's
  "Review customer-facing text" form). These are recorded as **manual
  founder reviews, not WAES evaluations**, and the run report lists them
  separately from WAES reviews. They count only while the run config has
  `"waesManualReviewAllowed": true`; turn it off once WAES runs as a
  service. See [genesis-run.md](genesis-run.md).
- **Boundaries:**
  - The legacy Sanity project and the Challenge endpoints stay refused.
  - The public Sanity Challenge instance stays synthetic.
  - AMP materials are never connected.
