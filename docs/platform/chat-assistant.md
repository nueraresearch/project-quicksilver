# Chat assistant

The chat panel is the one place a person talks to an agent. Its **Ask** mode is a read-only
assistant (`nuera-quicksilver:assistant`) that answers questions about the app and the company.
**Plan** and **Work** are separate, and they only propose.

## What it can read

It reads as the person asking, through the app's own routes (`apps/web/lib/chat-app-fetch.ts`):

| Tool | Reads | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `get_attention` | what needs you, with the actions you may take (see below) | `decision:read` |
| `get_my_access` | who you are and what you may do | signed in |
| `list_decisions`, `get_decision` | decisions, and the kernel's explanation of why | `decision:read` |
| `get_business_overview` | counts, metrics, experiments | `decision:read` |
| `get_finance_summary` | recorded money-ledger totals | `finance:read` |
| `get_workflow_activity`, `list_workflow_versions`, `get_workflow_runs` | workflow runs and versions | `workflow:read` |
| `get_trace_summary` | model and tool traces, alerts, cost | `audit:read` |
| `list_agent_catalog` | governed agent definitions | `agent:read` |
| `list_company_entities` | people, agents, teams | `decision:read` |

Company-model questions go through the Sanity Context tools, as before.

## How it is kept to what you can see

- Each tool runs the real route handler in the same process, with only your `Authorization`
  header and session cookie. The route's permission check, audit record and data shaping apply.
  No network request is made.
- A refused read comes back as "not available to you, you need X". The assistant is told to
  say so and not to look for another way.
- The tool list is fixed (`packages/agent/src/app-tools.ts`). Every tool is a `get_` or `list_`
  over one fixed GET path, with ids checked against a pattern. There is no tool that approves,
  rejects, executes, publishes, rolls back or writes. Those are buttons on the pages, pressed by a
  person, with separation of duties.
- Links in an answer are limited to pages of the app; anything else is dropped.
- Every call is a model route: rate limited, evaluated by the NQC engine, and recorded as an
  evaluation record and trace spans (`/monitoring/traces`).

## Not covered yet

- It cannot read the host's approved actions, Genesis experiments, hosting or media; the web app
  does not talk to the host.
- It does not stream. A conversation is kept for the tab (it survives closing the panel and a reload) and
  is gone when the tab closes.
- Published catalog agents cannot be run from chat: a catalog entry is a reviewed definition, and the
  app has no runtime that executes one. Only the seven built-in specialists and published workflows
  can be offered.
- Whether the Sanity dataset behind the company-model tools includes decision documents is not
  assumed: decisions come from the app tools.

## One chat, with cards for work

There are no Ask, Plan or Work modes. Every turn goes to the assistant. When the person describes
work, the assistant returns `offers`: up to three cards of kind `plan`, `specialist` or `workflow`.
The app validates each one (a known specialist, a well-formed workflow id, 3 to 2,000 characters)
and shows it in full with the text editable. **Nothing happens until the person presses the card's
button.** The press calls the app's own route (`/api/plan`, `/api/agents/run`, `/api/workflows/run`)
with the person's credentials and the text they saw, so the audit trail shows a person and a
misread question costs a click, not a record. There is no offer kind for approving, rejecting,
executing, publishing or rolling back. A plan card is disabled, with the reason, for a person who
lacks `decision:propose`.

The chat is told which page is open (a plain page, or `/decisions?id=<id>`) so "explain this
decision" works. The panel has Stop, Try again and New conversation, and a refused near-miss on a
decision page has "Try again with this change", which opens the chat with the request filled in.
`/planning` redirects to `/decisions`.

## What needs you

`GET /api/inbox` computes what needs the signed-in person from records and from what they may do.
No model is involved, so it is instant and cannot be paraphrased wrongly. The chat's empty state
shows it, and when you ask "what needs me?" the assistant answers in a sentence and sets
`showAttention`, which makes the app show the same live list under the answer.

- An item carries the actions the person may take. The server builds every item and every call; the
  chat component only shows them and makes the call a person clicks, as that person, through the
  decision routes. The model cannot create a button.
- Approve is one click only when the card shows everything the click covers (the action, the risk,
  the one-line why, the policy version) and the risk is not above the review ceiling. The click
  sends the fingerprint of what is shown, so a stale card is refused with a 409. Otherwise the card
  offers Review, which opens the decision.
- Nobody who requested, proposed or would carry out an action is offered its approval. A decision
  whose policy changed since it was planned is not offered for approval. Reject and execute ask
  first.
- Only items you can act on count toward the number. A source that could not be loaded is named, the
  number gets a "+", and the list says it may be incomplete. A source you may not read is skipped.
- It checks about once a minute and when the tab regains focus; it is not a live feed.

The same list is shown in three places, from one shared copy that the page checks once a minute:
the "Needs you" row at the top of the navigation (an icon beside the menu button on phones), the
"Needs your attention" card on the overview, and the empty chat. The count on the bell is only what
you can act on; a "+" means a source could not be checked, so the number may be low. The bell is
hidden when you are not signed in.

Not covered yet: executed decisions whose metric is still to be observed, the host's approved
actions and Genesis items, and memory awaiting a supervisor.
