# Triggers: schedules, business events and signed webhooks

`@quicksilver/kernel/triggers` starts workflow runs from cron schedules, signed
HTTP webhooks, and matched business events or metric samples. All three go
through `WorkflowRunQueue.enqueue`, so every run triggered this way gets the
same admission checks, idempotency, backpressure and RBAC as any other run.
Each trigger should act as a
**service principal that holds only the `trigger` role**. That role can
start runs and do nothing else.

## Cron schedules

```ts
import { CronScheduler } from '@quicksilver/kernel/triggers'

const scheduler = new CronScheduler({ queue })
scheduler.add({
  id: 'nightly-ops-report', tenantId: 'acme', cron: '0 2 * * *', graph,
  input: { report: 'ops' },
  principal: { id: 'svc:scheduler', kind: 'service', tenantId: 'acme', roles: ['trigger'] },
})
scheduler.start()      // polls every 30 s; scheduler.stop() for shutdown
```

- **Syntax:** 5 fields, in UTC. It supports lists, ranges and steps,
  day-of-week 0–7, and `@hourly`, `@daily`, `@weekly`, `@monthly` and
  `@yearly`. When both day fields are set, a day matches if either one does
  (the standard Vixie cron rule). A date that can never occur (such as
  February 31) never fires.
- **No duplicate runs:** each slot is enqueued with the idempotency key
  `schedule:<id>:<UTC minute>`. Restarts, overlapping ticks and several
  scheduler replicas can't create two runs for the same slot. The run input
  gets `scheduledFor` added.
- **No stampede after an outage:** a tick enqueues only the *most recent*
  missed slot, and only if it's inside `catchUpWindowMs` (1 hour by default).
- **Retries:** a slot rejected by backpressure is retried on the next tick. A
  slot refused by RBAC or graph validation is not retried.

## Business events and metric samples

`BusinessTriggerRegistry` matches in-process event or metric definitions and
enqueues matching work through the same governed `WorkflowRunQueue`. It does
not add a host management route or durable trigger-definition store: the caller
registers definitions at startup and calls `emitEvent` or `observeMetric` when
it receives the corresponding business signal.

```ts
import { BusinessTriggerRegistry } from '@quicksilver/kernel/triggers'

const business = new BusinessTriggerRegistry(queue)
business.add({
  id: 'late-orders', tenantId: 'acme', eventType: 'order.late', graph,
  principal: { id: 'svc:business-trigger', kind: 'service', tenantId: 'acme', roles: ['trigger'] },
})
business.add({
  id: 'high-downtime', tenantId: 'acme', metric: 'production.downtime',
  operator: 'gte', threshold: 20, graph,
  principal: { id: 'svc:business-trigger', kind: 'service', tenantId: 'acme', roles: ['trigger'] },
})

await business.emitEvent({
  tenantId: 'acme', eventType: 'order.late', eventId: 'evt-42', payload: { orderId: 'o-42' },
})
await business.observeMetric({
  tenantId: 'acme', metric: 'production.downtime', value: 22, sampleId: 'sample-9',
})
```

- Event definitions match exact tenant and event type. Metric definitions match
  exact tenant and metric name, then apply one of `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`,
  `eq` or `neq` against the configured threshold. Non-matching signals enqueue
  nothing.
- The queue applies tenant checks, RBAC, graph validation, backpressure and
  idempotency. Event keys are `business:event:<triggerId>:<eventId>`; metric
  keys are `business:metric:<triggerId>:<sampleId>`.
- **Retry the same signal with identical queue input.** Reuse the same
  event/sample ID and do not change its payload, metric value, or optional
  timestamp on retry. If `at` is supplied, it becomes `occurredAt` or
  `measuredAt`; when omitted, the registry does not add a fresh wall-clock time.
  This keeps a retry identical so the queue returns the existing run instead
  of refusing a reused key with changed input.
- Definitions live only in the registry instance. There is not yet a hosted
  trigger-management API, durable definition store, event-bus adapter or
  filesystem trigger.

## Signed webhooks

```ts
import { WebhookTrigger, generateWebhookSecret } from '@quicksilver/kernel/triggers'

const webhooks = new WebhookTrigger({
  queue,
  endpoints: [{
    id: 'erp-orders', tenantId: 'acme', graph,
    secrets: [process.env.ERP_WEBHOOK_SECRET!],       // ≥ 32 chars; add a second during rotation
    principal: { id: 'svc:erp-webhook', kind: 'service', tenantId: 'acme', roles: ['trigger'] },
  }],
})

// Next.js route handler: app/api/triggers/webhooks/[id]/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request, { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  return webhooks.handle(request, (await params).id)
}
```

**Sender contract.** Sign `${timestamp}.${rawBody}` with HMAC-SHA256 using
the endpoint secret, then send these headers:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `X-Quicksilver-Timestamp` | Unix seconds |
| `X-Quicksilver-Signature` | `v1=<hex>`. Send several, comma-separated, while rotating secrets |
| `X-Quicksilver-Delivery` | A unique id per event (recommended) |

`signWebhook(secret, timestamp, body)` produces the signature value.

**Checks, in order:** the endpoint exists and is enabled (404) → body size
(413) → content type (415) → timestamp within ±5 minutes and a
constant-time signature match against any current secret (401, with the
same message for every failure) → valid JSON (400) → replay check → enqueue.

**Idempotency and replays**

- With `X-Quicksilver-Delivery`, the run's idempotency key is
  `webhook:<endpoint>:<delivery>`. A sender retry, even one re-signed later,
  returns the same run with **200**, and the first delivery returns **202**.
- Without a delivery id, reusing the exact same signature is refused with
  **409**. Senders should always include a delivery id.
- The in-memory replay cache works for a single process. With several
  replicas, pass a shared `ReplayCache`. The delivery id plus a shared run
  store already prevents duplicate runs across replicas.

**Queue outcomes:** RBAC refusal → 403. Backpressure → 429, which tells the
sender to retry. Invalid workflow graph → 422.

### Stripe signature scheme

An endpoint with `scheme: "stripe"` reads Stripe's `Stripe-Signature:
t=<ts>,v1=<hex>` header instead of the `X-Quicksilver-*` headers. Stripe signs
the same `${timestamp}.${rawBody}` string with HMAC-SHA256, so the tolerance,
rotation and replay checks are unchanged. Stripe sends no delivery id, so the
signature stands in for one, and the sink deduplicates on the Stripe payload
itself. `signStripeWebhook(secret, ts, body)` builds the header for tests. The
host uses it for Genesis payment webhooks ([genesis-run](genesis-run.md#stripe-payments-into-the-ledger-p-027-recording-only)).

## Not yet built

- ~~Hosted process and management API~~ and ~~vault-backed endpoint
  secrets~~: see [hosted runtime](hosted-runtime.md). `setSecrets` rotates an
  endpoint's secrets in place, and `list()` returns endpoints without secrets.
- A shared replay cache backed by Postgres or Redis (needed only for several
  host replicas).
- Event-bus and filesystem triggers.
