# TypeScript SDK foundation

The private workspace package `@nuera/quicksilver-sdk` currently provides a
typed client for workflow graph validation, safe preview, and opt-in read-only
workflow runs. It requires an HTTPS API URL outside localhost, supports an
injected `fetch` for custom runtimes, accepts an `AbortSignal`, validates
response shapes, and reports structured HTTP errors. Read-only runs use the
existing `query` agent, return the full NQC evaluation contract including
routing and governed memory proposals, and require the server flag and
credentials described in the [workflow guide](workflow-graphs.md).

This is an internal SDK foundation, not a published package. Authentication,
agent creation, and broader hosted-run APIs depend on the platform identity and
authorization design. The internal Python client and `qs` CLI are documented
in the [Python SDK guide](sdk-python.md), and the dependency-free Go client
foundation is documented in the [Go SDK guide](sdk-go.md).

Run the offline client contract suite with `npm run sdk:test`. It checks URL
transport policy, request and response shapes, safety-mode invariants, NQC
evaluation fields, structured errors, and cancellation forwarding. The suite is
also part of `npm run verify` and the Ubuntu/Windows CI matrix. The CI matrix
requires five checks on every pull request: `verify` on both operating systems,
`go-sdk`, `python-sdk`, and `web-build` (a production build of the web console,
which `npm run verify` does not cover).
