# Nuera Quicksilver — Architecture

> Internal design document. Updated as decisions lock.

---

## 1. Canonical component names

The full subsystem is **Nuera Quicksilver**. Its final authority is the **NQC
Kernel** (Nuera Quicksilver Cognitive Kernel), its worker family is **Nuera
Quicksilver Agents**, and its deterministic evaluation core is the **Quicksilver
Engine**. The current code mapping and implementation boundaries are recorded
in [NUERA-QUICKSILVER-NAMING.md](./docs/NUERA-QUICKSILVER-NAMING.md).

## 1b. Product layers

The target product is set by the
[product definition](./docs/NUERA-QUICKSILVER-PRODUCT.md): an intent-driven
company operating system. This document describes the architecture that exists
today and how the planned layers plug into it.

| Layer | Role | Where it lives | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundation: platform runtime | Durable runs, triggers, registries, governed memory, routing, SDKs | `packages/kernel/src/{runtime,triggers,agents,tools,nqc}`, `packages/sdk*` | Foundation |
| Layer 1: NQC Kernel loop | Propose → evaluate → authorize → route → supervisor approval → execute and log | `packages/kernel` (sections 4–8b below) | Built / Foundation |
| Layer 2: intent loop | Turns an objective into a provenance-tagged decision graph | Planned (section 8d) | Not built |
| Layer 3: playbook loops | Business playbooks stored as content: process stages that run workflow graphs | Planned (section 8d) | Building blocks exist |

The layers stay separate. Layers 2 and 3 never gain authority: everything they
want done arrives at the kernel as a proposal.

The Supervisor Agent is a governed control-plane worker, not a second authority
plane. It coordinates evaluation, routes approval-required work to a Human
Supervisor, submits only kernel-issued execution authorizations, observes
outcomes, and proposes rollback. Its `agent` identity cannot hold authority
permissions, approve itself, impersonate a human, or change the action/policy/
evidence binding. See the [authoritative enterprise specification](./docs/NUERA-QUICKSILVER-ENTERPRISE-SPEC-v1.md).

## 2. The model

A company is not a document. It is a graph of **entities** (humans, agents, systems, services) bound by **policies**, **capabilities**, **permissions**, and **evidence**, pursuing **objectives** through **workflows**, producing and consuming **state**.

Nuera Quicksilver's job is to make that graph **machine-queryable**, **reason-over-able**, and **authoritative**.

## 3. The schema (locked Day 1, refined Days 2–5)

Ten core document types, plus `automationWorkflow` for versioned workflow graphs (section 8c). Enough to express the company; few enough to keep authoring manageable. The product layers add seven more types (section 8d).

| Type | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `organization` | The fictional company (root doc) | implemented |
| `department` | Organizational units with leader, members, capabilities, objectives | implemented |
| `entity` | The unified entity abstraction (human, agent, robot, service, system, contractor) | implemented |
| `capability` | What can be done, by whom, with what risk and tools | implemented |
| `policy` | Rules with scope, priority, supersedes, appliesTo, approvalRequirements | implemented |
| `objective` | Goal with deadline, constraints, successMetrics, budget, status | implemented |
| `workflow` | State machine: states, transitions, requiredCapabilities, rollback | implemented |
| `evidence` | Source of truth with type, claim, confidence, supports/contradicts | implemented |
| `decision` | Auditable record: question, evidence, candidateActions, selectedAction, policyChecks, riskLevel, status | implemented |
| `metric` | Measurable state with baseline + direction; not seeded — created at runtime by the closed-loop execute/observe flow | implemented |

Schema lives in `apps/studio/schemas/`. Deployed via `sanity schema deploy` (required for Context MCP GROQ mode).

### The `entity` abstraction (key insight)

```
entity {
  name
  entityType     // human | agent | robot | service | contractor | system
  capabilities[] // refs to capability docs
  permissions[]  // refs to policy/permission docs
  constraints[]  // refs to policy docs that constrain this entity
  reportsTo      // ref to entity
  department     // ref to department
  availability
  riskProfile
  costProfile
}
```

This lets the kernel reason about humans and machines using **the same organizational primitive**. Crucial for "the agent" being just another entity with a `entityType: agent`.

## 4. The runtime

## 5. Architectural principle: separate cognition from authority

The LLM proposes. The kernel authorizes. **Never** the other way around.

```ts
// Illustrative pseudocode. The real calls are planObjective() in
// packages/agent/src/planner.ts and authorize() in packages/kernel/src/approval.ts,
// which returns { authorized, riskLevel, requiresApproval, recommendation,
//                 blockingReasons, concerns }.

// ❌ wrong
const decision = await llm(`Can ${entity} do ${action}?`)

// ✅ right
const proposal = await planner.propose(objective, context)
const decision = kernel.authorize({
  actor: proposal.actor,
  action: proposal.action,
  capability: proposal.requiredCapability,
  policies: proposal.applicablePolicies,
  evidence: proposal.supportingEvidence,
})
// kernel.decision is { authorized: boolean, riskLevel: 0-5, requiresApproval: boolean, reasons: [...] }
```

This is what makes Quicksilver more than a chatbot. The agent has *opinions*; the kernel has *authority*.

## 6. Model configuration

Models are role names. Names are IDs. Roles are code.

```ts
// packages/agent/src/models.ts
export type QuicksilverModelRole = 'planner' | 'reviewer' | 'router' | 'executor'

export const MODELS: Record<QuicksilverModelRole, string> = {
  planner:  'gpt-5.6-sol',
  reviewer: 'claude-sonnet-5',
  router:   'gpt-5.6-luna',
  executor: 'gemini-3.8-flash',
}
```

These are the direct-provider defaults. The live deployment runs on Azure OpenAI, where each role maps to a deployment (`qs-planner`, `qs-reviewer`, `qs-router`, `qs-executor`). Only the **planner** and **reviewer** are called at runtime today; `router` and `executor` are configured and health-checked by `npm run verify:llm`, and execution is simulated.

## 7. The MCP integration

### Reads — Sanity Context MCP (hosted, read-only)

```
Endpoint: https://api.sanity.io/v1/context/organizations/:orgId/mcp/:endpointName
Auth:     Bearer <SANITY_CONTEXT_TOKEN, org-scoped, Context Viewer permission>
Modes:    GROQ (live dataset, structured) | Knowledge Base (compiled index)
Tools:    initial_context, schema_explorer, groq_query, array_field_reader (GROQ)
          initial_context, knowledge_base_read (KB)
```

Prerequisites:
- Context enabled on org (Manage → Labs → Context)
- Org API token with `Context Viewer` grant
- For GROQ mode: `sanity schema deploy` (Studio ≥5.1.0)

### Writes — Sanity HTTP API (direct)

Context MCP is read-only. Decision records, state updates, execution logs, and workflow transitions go through Next.js API route handlers (`apps/web/app/api/**`) using `@sanity/client` mutations. Simpler than wiring a second MCP client.

```
Endpoint: https://<projectId>.api.sanity.io/v2024-10-01/data/mutate/<dataset>   (via @sanity/client)
Auth:     Bearer <SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN>
```

## 8. The decision object (auditability without private reasoning traces)

We do not store chain-of-thought. We store the **decision artifact**:

```
decision {
  question
  context[]              // refs to entity, capability, policy docs that were considered
  candidateActions[]
  selectedAction
  reasoningSummary       // one-paragraph human-readable explanation
  evidence[]             // refs to evidence docs supporting the choice
  constraints[]
  policyChecks[]         // [{ policy (ref), result: applies|superseded|conflicts|inapplicable, reason }]
  riskLevel              // 0-5, computed by kernel
  requiredApproval       // bool, computed by kernel
  status                 // proposed | awaiting-approval | approved | rejected | executed
                         //   | failed | rollback-proposed | rolled-back
  kind                   // plan | rollback  (rollbackOf → the decision being rolled back)
  process                // { definition ref, version, revision } of the lifecycle in force
  processHistory[]       // one row per transition: from, to, transition, actor, version, _rev, at
  reviewerNotes          // the independent reviewer's advisory output
  createdAt
  approvedBy?            // ref to entity (human) if status >= approved
  executedAt?
}
```

Judges see *why* without exposing internal LLM scratch space.

## 8. The kill-shot demo moment

A policy conflict surfaced mid-decision. What the kernel computes for the
parameter change (the card shows these fields; wording of the plan varies
per run):

```
PROPOSED ACTION   Adjust CNC 2 controller parameter X by +5%
Actor             Engineering Agent (holds Process Parameter Modification ✓)
Risk              5 / 5   ·  reversible: no
Policy conflict   Multiple non-superseded policies share scope
                  "production.parameter_changes": Operations Policy 17,
                  Emergency Policy 4
Recommendation    request-approval  →  Awaiting human approval (route-to-human)
```

The contradicting evidence (Historical Incident #17: worn hydraulic seal,
confidence 0.92) is surfaced by the agent and by the Knowledge Base's own
contradiction detection, not by the kernel.

That single interaction demonstrates: structured content, relationships, provenance, policy, authority, reasoning, workflow, human-in-the-loop, agent execution.

## 8b. Process engine: workflows the kernel executes

The `workflow` document type (Studio label: "Process definition") is
executable. `packages/kernel/src/process.ts` runs it:

```
ProcessDefinition { id, name, version, revision (_rev), initialState,
                    states[{ id, label, terminal }],
                    transitions[{ id, from, to, automatic, requiresHumanApproval,
                                  guard: { all[], any[] } of { fact, op, value } }] }

validateProcessDefinition(def)      // ids, dangling refs, reachability, dead ends, guard shape
evaluateGuard(guard, facts)         // closed operator set; missing fact → false; no eval
authorizeTransition({ definition, currentState, transitionId | to, facts, actor })
nextAutomaticTransition(def, state, facts)   // first automatic transition whose guard holds
historyEntry(def, decision, actor, at)       // audit row incl. version + revision
```

Principles:

- **Guards are data, never code.** No string is ever evaluated, so a
  definition, even one an agent proposes later, can't inject logic
  into the kernel.
- **Fail closed.** Missing facts fail their conditions. An invalid
  definition authorizes nothing. `requiresHumanApproval` transitions
  refuse non-human actors.
- **Auditable.** Every allowed transition appends `processHistory` on the
  decision with the definition version and `_rev`. Writes use
  `ifRevisionId`, so a stale click can't apply a transition from an old
  state.
- **Single source of truth.** `apps/studio/seed/workflows.ts` is both the
  Sanity seed and the kernel test fixture. `process-document.ts`
  round-trips it to Sanity's typed fields, and that round trip is tested.

The **Decision Lifecycle** definition governs every `decision`:

```
proposed ─kernel-reject (auto)──────────────▶ rejected ■
proposed ─auto-approve (auto, risk ≤ 2)─────▶ approved
proposed ─route-to-human (auto)─────────────▶ awaiting-approval
awaiting-approval ─approve / reject (human)─▶ approved / rejected ■
awaiting-approval ─request-evidence (human)─▶ awaiting-approval
approved ─execute (execution.success)───────▶ executed | failed
executed ─propose-rollback (human, deviation observed)─▶ rollback-proposed
failed   ─propose-rollback-after-failure (human)─▶ rollback-proposed
rollback-proposed ─complete-rollback (rollback executed)─▶ rolled-back ■
rollback-proposed ─retry-rollback (human; last attempt failed, none pending)─▶ rollback-proposed
```

8 states, 12 transitions. `route-to-human` is the catch-all for every
decision that isn't hard-blocked and isn't auto-approved (v3), so tightening
the auto-approve ceiling in Studio is a one-number edit.

v2 (after the Sep 22 live stress test) also restricts rollback proposals to
`decision.kind = plan`, so a rollback is never rolled back. It also adds
`POST /api/decisions/[id]/resume`, which re-runs the automatic step for a
decision held in `proposed` (for example while the definition was invalid),
using the kernel verdict stored on the decision.

Wiring: `apps/web/lib/process-engine.ts`, used by `/api/plan` and
`/api/decisions/[id]/{action,execute,observe,rollback,resume}`. It's behind
`QUICKSILVER_PROCESS_ENGINE=on`. If the definition isn't in the
dataset, the routes fall back to their built-in checks. If it's present
but invalid, the decision routes return 409 and move nothing, and
`/api/plan` still records the plan but holds every decision in `proposed`
(resumable once the definition is fixed).

## 8c. NQC and platform additions since the challenge build

These are built on the challenge-era kernel without changing its authorization
core (`approval.ts`, `risk.ts`, `authority.ts` and `capability.ts` are
unchanged). Details are in the linked docs.

- **Quicksilver Engine evaluation** (`engine/`, `nqc/`): deterministic
  grounding, tool-failure, uncertainty and brittleness signals. The NQC safety
  decision is `ALLOW`, `ESCALATE` or `BLOCK`. Evaluation can escalate an
  authorized action to a human; it can never reverse a kernel rejection. See
  [NQC Kernel](./docs/nqc/README.md).
- **Supervisor approval binding:** an approval is tied to the exact action,
  its risk, and a SHA-256 snapshot of the policy revisions in force. Execution
  re-checks both. See [supervisor approval](./docs/platform/supervisor-approval.md).
- **Identity and RBAC** (`identity/`): deny by default, isolated per tenant,
  agents barred from authority, separation of duties. See
  [identity and RBAC](./docs/platform/identity-rbac.md).
- **Agent manifests and the standard agent contract** (`agents/`,
  `packages/agent/src/contracts.ts`): every agent call is registered,
  versioned and evaluated before its result can continue.
- **Workflow graphs** (`workflows/`): an acyclic graph of trigger, agent, tool,
  condition and output nodes. Side-effect and high-impact nodes need
  evaluation plus supervisor approval, and tools are never auto-retried. See
  [workflow graphs](./docs/platform/workflow-graphs.md).
- **Durable runs and triggers** (`runtime/`, `triggers/`): governed queue,
  worker, dead letters, cron and signed webhooks. See
  [durable runs](./docs/platform/durable-runs.md) and
  [triggers](./docs/platform/triggers.md).
- **Governed memory and routing** (`nqc/memory.ts`, `nqc/memory-store.ts`,
  `nqc/routing.ts`): fail-closed memory writes, a persistent store behind them,
  and role-based model selection. The store is a hash-chained file per tenant
  (`<store dir>/<tenant>/memory.json`, host with the file run store); every
  write goes through the governor, each entry records who proposed it, entries
  expire, only a person can forget one, and a file that was edited will not
  load. Recalled memory is advisory text: no authorization module reads it
  (`memory-boundary.test.ts` checks the imports). Not yet done: recalled
  lessons are not injected into agent prompts, there is no API to list or
  forget memories, and the web app (serverless) has no store, so only the host
  keeps memory. Routing is still not persisted.

## 8d. Target: intent and playbook layers

Planned, per the [product definition](./docs/NUERA-QUICKSILVER-PRODUCT.md).
Nothing in this section exists in code yet.

- **Intent layer (Layer 2):** a new `intent` document holds the human's
  statement, the parsed objective, constraints, autonomy depth and mode.
  `graphVariable` documents hold each business variable with a provenance tag
  (`HUMAN_SPECIFIED`, `OBSERVED`, `AGENT_INFERRED`, `SYSTEM_CONSTRAINT`),
  confidence, evidence and dependents. Belief updates can only change
  `AGENT_INFERRED` values and go through the memory governor.
- **Playbooks (Layer 3):** a `playbook` document joins a process definition
  (business stages; can loop; human-only transitions) to the workflow graph
  each stage runs. The graph's output becomes the facts that guard the next
  stage transition. The economic playbook is the Genesis default, one of
  several.
- **Supporting types:** `experiment` (hypothesis, thresholds set before start,
  budget, results), `ledgerEntry` (spend and revenue, including compute),
  `connector` (the source of `OBSERVED` values in Onboard mode) and
  `wellbeingReview` (WAES results; a failure is a hard block).
- **Kernel changes:** a spend risk scale suited to small budgets, and a
  passing WAES review as required evidence for customer-facing proposals.

The layer contracts (intent → playbook → kernel → executor, and back) are
listed in the product definition and tracked in
[spec coverage](./docs/NUERA-QUICKSILVER-SPEC-COVERAGE.md#product-layers-intent-and-playbooks).

## 9. Out of scope for the original challenge build

> Recorded from the Sanity Challenge build. Several items (multi-tenancy, authentication, specialised agents, a marketplace) are now on the Nuera Quicksilver [roadmap](./docs/NUERA-QUICKSILVER-ROADMAP.md).

- Real robotic control
- Real financial transactions
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Auth complexity (single-user demo)
- Full ERP, CRM, HR, payroll
- Multiple specialized agents (CEO agent, COO agent, …) — one primary agent with a kernel
- A general-purpose autonomous agent marketplace

## 10. Challenge-build Day 1 questions (all resolved)

- [x] Sanity org ID: `ou5ydq271`, Context enabled
- [x] Public dataset for judge inspection: `production` is public
- [x] Enter both paths: yes
- [x] Working demo: live at https://quicksilver-seven.vercel.app (the challenge deployment, from [quicksilver-sanity-challenge](https://github.com/nuerainc/quicksilver-sanity-challenge); this repo is not deployed)
